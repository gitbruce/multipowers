# Product Guidelines

## Decision Rules
1. Prefer user impact over technical novelty.
2. Keep workflows deterministic and debuggable.
3. Every "DONE" claim needs reproducible evidence.

## Quality Gates
- Requirements are explicit and testable.
- Error paths are observable.
- Backward compatibility is considered.

## UX & Communication
- Error messages should include next-step guidance.
- Command outputs should separate user output and diagnostics.
