# Code Style Baseline (User Project)

- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the track/task.
- Use clear names and consistent domain terminology.
- Preserve existing project conventions unless intentionally refactoring.
- Prefer readable, maintainable code over clever shortcuts.
- Add or update focused tests for behavior changes.
- Avoid unrelated refactors in the same change unless justified.
