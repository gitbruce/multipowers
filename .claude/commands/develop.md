# Develop - Development Phase 🛠️

## 🤖 INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

When the user invokes this command (e.g., `/octo:develop <arguments>`):

### Step 0: Enforce Conductor Context Guard

- This is a spec-driven command; before proceeding, verify required context exists under `$PWD/.multipowers/`:
  - `product.md`
  - `product-guidelines.md`
  - `tech-stack.md`
  - `workflow.md`
  - `tracks.md`
  - `CLAUDE.md`
- If any context file is missing, you MUST execute:
```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/orchestrate.sh" --dir "$PWD" init
```
- Re-check all required files and hard-stop if any are still missing.
- Continue only after context is present.
- Do **not** perform any implementation action (`Write/Edit/Update`) before Step 0 is complete.

**✓ CORRECT - Use the Skill tool:**
```
Skill(skill: "octo:develop", args: "<user's arguments>")
```

**✗ INCORRECT - Do NOT use Task tool:**
```
Task(subagent_type: "octo:develop", ...)  ❌ Wrong! This is a skill, not an agent type
```

**Why:** This command loads the `flow-develop` skill. Skills use the `Skill` tool, not `Task`.

---

**Auto-loads the `flow-develop` skill for the implementation phase.**

## Quick Usage

Just use natural language:
```
"Build a user authentication system"
"Implement OAuth 2.0 flow"
"Create a caching layer for the API"
```

## What Is Develop?

The **Develop** phase of the Double Diamond methodology (divergent thinking for solutions):
- Multiple implementation approaches via external CLI providers
- Code generation and technical patterns
- Quality gate validation

## What You Get

- Multi-AI implementation (Claude + Gemini + Codex)
- Multiple implementation approaches
- Quality gate validation (75% consensus threshold)
- Security checks (OWASP compliance)
- Best practices enforcement

## When to Use Develop

Use develop when you need:
- **Building**: "Build X" or "Implement Y"
- **Creating**: "Create Z feature"
- **Code Generation**: "Write code to do Y"

**Don't use develop for:**
- Simple code edits (use Edit tool)
- Reading or reviewing code (use Read/review skills)
- Trivial single-file changes

## Part of the Full Workflow

Develop is phase 3 of 4 in the embrace (full) workflow:
1. Discover
2. Define
3. **Develop** <- You are here
4. Deliver

To run all 4 phases: `/octo:embrace`
