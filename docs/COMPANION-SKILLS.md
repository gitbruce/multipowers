## How Skills Work with Multipowers

**Important:** Installed skills are available to **Claude (the orchestrator)**, not to the individual agents (Codex/Gemini CLIs) spawned by Multipowers.

**Typical workflow:**
```
1. User requests a task
   ↓
2. Claude (has all skills) uses Multipowers for multi-AI orchestration
   ↓
3. Octopus spawns Codex/Gemini agents (separate CLIs without skills)
   ↓
4. Agents return parallel results
   ↓
5. Claude (with skills) validates, tests, and polishes results
```

**Example:**
- **Before orchestration:** Claude might use `frontend-design` to establish design principles
- **During orchestration:** Agents generate code following those principles
- **After orchestration:** Claude uses `webapp-testing` to validate the result

This separation keeps agents focused on their core tasks while Claude coordinates and applies domain-specific skills.
