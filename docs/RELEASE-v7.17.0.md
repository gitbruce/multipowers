## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Full Workflow with State

```bash
# Discover: Research auth patterns
/mp:discover "authentication patterns for web apps"
# → State: Records research findings

# Define: Clarify requirements
/mp:define "JWT authentication system"
# → Asks: User flow? Approach? Scope?
# → State: Records decisions and context

# Develop: Build implementation
/mp:develop "implement JWT auth"
# → Reads: Prior decisions from state
# → State: Records implementation approach

# Deliver: Validate quality
/mp:deliver "review auth implementation"
# → Reads: Full workflow context
# → Runs: Stub detection
# → State: Final metrics
```

# → Direct implementation
# → Atomic commit
# → Summary generated
# → State updated

# Fast dependency update

## 🚀 Migration Guide

### From v7.16.1 to v7.17.0

**No breaking changes** - all existing functionality preserved.

**New capabilities available immediately:**
1. State automatically initialized on workflow execution
2. Validation gates enforce quality
3. Phase discussion optional (flow-define asks questions)
4. Stub detection runs on code review
5. Quick mode available via `/mp:quick`

**Optional migration steps:**
1. Review `.claude-octopus/state.json` after workflows
2. Use phase discussion to capture intent
3. Try quick mode for simple tasks
4. Check stub detection in reviews

**Backwards compatible:**
- All existing commands work unchanged
- No configuration required
- Graceful degradation if state missing
